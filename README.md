This is a project copying a google form. It has a html, js, css fronted and go backend. The project can be run in two ways:
    1) Cloning the repository. Installing the latest version of go, going to the backend directory in a terminal, writing "go mod tidy" and after that writing "go run main.go". After that double click on the forms.html file.
    2) Cloning the repository. Go into the repository and run the command "docker compose up" or "sudo docker compose up" if it shows up that you don't have the permissions to do this. After that go to "http://localhost:8080/forms.html" in your browser.

Note: The project may not work if you are using firefox as your browser. If it doesn't work please open it in another browser.
